# Country Information

## Description

* _Neither in science nor in international law there is a single and generally accepted definition of the concept of "state". "Country" is a term close, but not identical to the state, as a rule, it is understood more broadly than "state". The largest international organization, the United Nations, does not have the authority to determine whether a particular entity is a state or not; this is a matter of international legal recognition by other states and governments. One of the few documents defining a "state" in international law is the Montevideo Convention, signed in 1933 by only a few American states._
